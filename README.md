# React-Video-Player-Mini-Project

My React Video Player project includes a drop-down selection of rap battle videos from YouTube, displaying video titles. The default video is embedded on page load, and selecting a different video dynamically updates the embedded video. Styling and layout demonstrate front-end skills.

## Features
